	  					<p><h5>Black coffee is simply coffee<br/> that is normally brewed without<br/> the addition 
	  					of additives such as<br/> sugar, milk, cream or added flavours.<br/>While it has a slightly 
	  					bitter taste<br/> compared to when it is flavoured<br/> with additives, many people love<br/> 
	  					a strong cup 	of black coffee.</h5></p></button>

								Espresso<hr><p><h5>Espresso is a concentrated form of<br/> coffee served in small, strong shots
								<br/> and is the base for many coffee drinks. <br/>It's made from the same beans as coffee<br/> 
								but is stronger, thicker, and higher in<br/> caffeine. However, because espresso is <br/>
				typically served in smaller servings than <br/>coffee,it has less caffeine per serving.</h5></p></button>

												<h1 style="text-align:left;">how to make:</h1>
												<p>
												<ol style="text-align:left;">
																<li>Gather the ingredients and tools</li>
																<li>Pour hot water into the serving cup to warm it.</li>
																<li>Add water to a gooseneck kettle and heat it on the stove until it reaches between 195 F and 205 F.</li>
																<li>Grind coffee beans to a medium to fine ground (about the size of kosher salt or coarse sand).</li>
																<li>Measure the ground coffee in the pour-over brewer.</li>
																<li>When the water is heated, dump the water from the cup. Set the drip cone on the cup's rim. If using an all-in-one brewer, assemble the pieces, then measure the coffee.</li>
																<li>Zero out the scale and start the timer. Beginning in the center of the coffee grounds and working your way around, pour just enough water (about 1 3/4 ounces/50 mL) from the kettle to wet all of the coffee. Let it bloom and saturate the coffee for between 30 and 45 seconds.</li>
																<li>With the kettle spout as close to the cone as possible, continue to slowly pour water over the bed of coffee. Work in even circles, starting in the middle and moving outwards (when the water drains, the grounds should be flat, not concave). Do not pour water onto the cone or filter, only onto the coffee. Pause as needed to let it catch up until you have poured the full 10 ounces (300mL) of water.

The goal is to have a total brewing time of 3 to 4 minutes for medium roast coffee and as little as 2 1/2 to 3 minutes for a dark roast. It will continue to dip for about 30 seconds after you've added all the water.

</li>
																<li>Tap the cone to release the last bits of coffee, then set it on a second cup or saucer to catch any additional drips. Serve and enjoy!</li>

												<h1 style="text-align:left; ">Tips:</h1>
												<p>
																<ul style="text-align:left;">
															<li>For the most accurate measurements, use metric units to weigh the coffee and water.</li>
															<li>This recipe uses a coffee to water ratio of 1:17. For a stronger brew, 
															try 1:16 or 1:14.</li>
															<li>If the coffee is too weak or sour, try a finer grind. If it's bitter, 
															adjust to a coarser grind.</li>
															<li>No scale in the kitchen? It is possible to do pour-over without one,
															 though it won't be as precise. Measure out 4 tablespoons of ground coffee,
															 and fill the kettle with 1 1/4 cups of water.</li>
															<li>If you don't have a thermometer, bring the water to a near-boil or just until 
															the kettle begins to steam.</li>
															<li>For brewers that require paper filters, stock up on that specific style
															 because they may not be readily available in the average store.</li>
															<li>Want to eliminate the filter's "paper" taste? Rinse it with hot water in the 
															cone before adding the ground coffee (you'll heat the cup simultaneously).</li>
															<li>Metal cone drippers eliminate the need for disposable filters. They often 
															include a small brush to help clean out the used grounds.</li>
															<li>When making a large batch of pour-over, take precautions to avoid an overflow. 
															Ensure you're dripping into a large enough vessel and don't fill 
															the cone more than two-thirds with grounds.</li>
															<li>Pour-over brewers come in various sizes. Choose one that meets your general needs.</li>

												</div>
												<h1>What you Need to Make it:</h1>
												
											<ul>
															<li>2 oz.freshly brewed espresso (2 shots)</li>
															<li>8 oz.whole milk</li>
											</ul>
												<!-- latte HTM -->
												<h1>how to make:</h1>
												<ol>
																<li>Add the espresso into a 12-ounce mug, Set aside.</li>
																<li>Pour the milk into a frothing pitcher large enough to hold at least 12 ounces. Angle 
											 					the pitcher slightly (this will make it easy to keep an eye on the milk) and submerge
																 the steam wand diagonally into the lower right quadrant and turn it on. Don’t be 
																 startled by the loud noise as steam pushes through the wand. It’s normal! The milk 
																 will start moving in a circular motion. The tip of the wand should be about two 
																 inches below the surface and should not touch the wall of the pitcher.  Keep it in the 
																 same position the whole time. If the tip of the wand is too shallow, it’ll create too 
																 many bubbles making the milk overflow. It should look creamy and silky, without too 
																 much foam on top. The bubbles should be tiny and uniform. </li>														
																<li>Stop the frother when the milk reaches 140ºF to 150ºF (you should be able to 
																	comfortably hold the side of the hot pitcher for about three seconds). </li>
																<li>Gently tap the pitcher on the counter and swirl it around to pop any large bubbles 
																 and even out the texture of the milk. </li>
																<li>Gently pour the frothed milk over the espresso in a slow narrow stream. There should 
																 be up to a three quarter-inch layer of foam on top of the latte.</li>
												</ol>												
												<!-- latte TIPS -->
												<div class="tips">
												<h1 >Tips:</h1>
												<p >
																<ul>
																				<li>Pour the milk onto the espresso gently. You want to slowly integrate the oils in
																				 the coffee with the proteins in the milk for a cohesive drink.</li>
																				<li>If you like flavored syrups (vanilla syrup for a vanilla latte or chocolate syrup 
																					for a mocha latte), add it into your cup first. Brew the espresso over it to help
																			  it fully dissolve.</li>
																				<li>Whole milk produces thicker and creamier foam that will easily blend with 
																				 the espresso. Steamed skim milk is foamier — for beginners, skim milk is easier to 
																				 froth since bubbles form easily and stay stiff. As for non-dairy options? Oat 
																				 milk froths best.</li>
																				<li>If you buy coffee beans from a local roaster, ask them what grind size they 
																		 		recommend for espresso. Depending on the type of bean and when it was roasted, they 
													 							may have a specific suggestion.</li>
																				<li>If possible, use just-ground coffee. Pre-ground coffee will lose its flavor and 
																				 aroma over time.</li>

												different types of coffee until you find the perfect 
												combination for your taste buds.The Moka Pot takes a little experimentation since it isn’t an
