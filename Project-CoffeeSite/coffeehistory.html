<h1> coffee history</h1>

<p>The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century,

and possibly earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first use.

The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree is

from the early 15th century, in the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon to Mecca and Medina.

By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East, South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey,

the Horn of Africa, and northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to the rest of Europe,

as well as Southeast Asia and despite the bans imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca and Cairo,

and later by the Catholic Church</p>

<p>Through thousands of Arabs pilgrimaging to Mecca
the enjoyment and harvesting of coffee,
or the "wine of Araby" spread to other Arab countries (e.g. Egypt, Syria)
and eventually to a majority of the world through the 16th century. Coffee,
in addition to being essential in the home, became a major part of social life.
